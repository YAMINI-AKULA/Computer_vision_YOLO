## This project utilizes the YOLOv8 model to accurately detect soccer balls in both images and videos. YOLOv8 is known for its high speed and precision, making it an excellent choice for real-time object detection tasks.

Technologies Used
        -       Python: Core language for implementation.
	-	YOLOv8: State-of-the-art object detection model used for soccer ball detection.
	-	Google Colab: For training, testing, and model refinement with GPU acceleration.
	-	OpenCV: Employed for image and video processing, including detection and visualization.


Features
        •	YOLOv8 Architecture: Leveraged the latest advancements in YOLO architecture for superior detection performance.
	•	Custom Dataset Training: Fine-tuned the model on a custom dataset of soccer ball images to enhance detection 
                accuracy across various lighting conditions, angles, and environments.
	•	Real-Time Processing: Capable of detecting soccer balls in live video feeds and images with minimal latency.

	
Results
        •	High Accuracy: Achieved an IoU score of over 0.85, indicating strong overlap between predicted bounding 
                               boxes and the actual location of soccer balls in test images and videos.
	•	Detection Precision: The YOLOv8 model reached an accuracy of over 95% in identifying soccer balls 
                                     across diverse scenarios, including various angles, distances, and lighting conditions.
	•	Inference Speed: Maintained real-time detection speeds with an average processing time of <15 ms per frame on GPU,  
                                   making it suitable for live broadcasting and sports analytics.
